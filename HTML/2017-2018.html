<h3> Pegguy </h3>
<p>Pegguy is a 2D platformer created for a game design contest. The theme was "Label and the Beast." We decided to focus on the PEGI rating system, which classifies games based on their violence, imagery, etc. The game consists of several slices of Pegguy’s life at different ages, which the player will discover. The game is a caricature of PEGI ratings, always pushing the limits. </p>

<h3> Knowledge to Escape </h3>
<p> Knowledge to Escape is a game created during the 2018 Global Game Jam, whose theme was "Transmission." The player controls a small character who must escape from a laboratory.<br>
Unfortunately, time is his enemy, and he is forced to respawn in his HUB every 30 seconds. To progress through the story, he must collect neurons scattered across the map to purchase abilities such as jumping, crouching, or even extending his free time outside the HUB. The game consists of two levels as well as a <a href="https://soundcloud.com/brieux-caquelin/bios">a unique sound atmosphere</a>.

<h3> 2048 </h3>
<p> 2048 is a small project that I supervised with high school people from my former school during my second year of university. It is the famous mobile game in a computer version, fully coded in Python 3.<br>
My role in this project was to create a clean version that served as a reference for the students, helping them develop better games. </p>
<p>The game is available as a ZIP file via <a href="../IMG/2048.zip">this link</a></p>
