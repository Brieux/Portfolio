<h1>Professional project</h1>
<h3> INSERM - Voyage au coeur des vaisseaux sanguins (NDA)</h3>
<p>During a year I've worked with INSERM's scientific and doctors to create a serious game about blood donation. The aim of the game was to teach people the utility of giving their blood and all the mechanical process of each blood cells. </p>
<p>We've decided together to use the VR Headset to get a better immersive experience and to use the easy controls from VR Games <br>
The game is light in term of gameplay because we didn't want to block the player against the game and getting frustrated to not reach any informations.</p>
<p> Through the whole game scientific facts are displayed using books which can be fund on the ground. <br>
One of the most key of the game was to create something correct in terms of mechanical process & facts. The game is not realease on stores yet but it is use in blood giving's truck in Grand Est area and only there.</p>

<h3> Nyamyam (NDA)</h3>
<p>I've work as freelance Gameplay programer in remote during 6 mounth with Nyamyam, under the lead of Pavle MIHAJLOVIC (lead technical) and Jennifer SCHNEIDEREIT (owner and CEO of Nyamyam)
we've created all the vertical slice of a VR Game.
<br> First of all I was in charge of protyping all differents aspect of gameplay using my own interpretation of the GDD.
<br>Then daily and weekly we reviewed together the work and polish it to Jennifer's first ideas of the game.
After 4 month we decided to get through a high polish moment to get the best vertical slice to show.</p>
<p> As it was a vertical slice I also created a lot of tools to get the levels design easy for the future with a full documentation of all my work.</p>
<p>We also get a lot of optimization process as we were using high ressources technologies.</p>
