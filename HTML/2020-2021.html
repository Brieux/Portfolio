<h3>Board game: Magic Di Rosa</h3>
<p> Magic Di Rosa is a semester-long board game creation project at ETPA. The goal of the project is to recreate an existing board game by combining a film and an artist. In this case, I worked with Hervé Di Rosa, a Sete-based artist, and Porco Rosso, one of Miyazaki’s films. All the graphics and illustrations were entirely designed by me and refined by a graphic design student.

<h3>Ataraxy </h3>
<p>Ataraxy is a game from the 2021 Global Game Jam, whose theme was "Lost and Found." Ataraxy is a narrative game where the goal is to collect artifacts, each representing a different emotion, to achieve ataraxia (peace of mind). The game design primarily consists of two phases: navigating the player’s soul through a maze-like environment, and a more technical phase, where the player must probe a 3D area to locate the invisible artifact.
<br> A visual of the game is available, as well as the <a href="https://v3.globalgamejam.org/2021/games/ataraxy-2"> playable version </a>

<h3>Lardon's Adventure</h3>
<p>Lardon’s Adventure is my end-of-first-year project at ETPA. It is a web-based platformer created using Phaser 3 (a JS library). The goal was to take inspiration from Mario Bros and its mechanics to create a unique platformer. In this game, the player can enter a second gameplay phase where time stops, allowing them to program their own abilities using programming points.

<h3>Rec</h3>
<p>Here is REC, a game prototype created by my first-year classmates in Montpellier as part of the "Video Game Creation" course.
The goal was to create a fully playable game within a month and a half, with a clear beginning and end. It should be noted that the programming, level design, and sound design were done by us, while the 3D assets and the clone animation came from an existing library.

In this puzzle-infused FPS, the player finds themselves in a laboratory, serving as a test subject. Every action they take is recorded by the AI over a set period, which then creates a clone that replicates the player’s actions to help solve puzzles. The gameplay lasts approximately 25–30 minutes, covering seven puzzles in addition to the tutorial.</p>

<h3>Mutegg</h3>

<p>Mutegg is a game created during an inter-campus Game Jam at my school. The theme was "Communicate Without Speaking." The goal was to make a game that is fun from the very first second of gameplay. To achieve this, we decided to create a split-screen, two-player game. </p>
<p>I was responsible for all the programming, while my teammates handled level design, level art, game design, and narrative. The player takes on the role of a company manager who must get their employees to work in the meeting rooms. To do this, the player has three actions: they can point the way to influence employees with eyes, clap their hands to call those with ears, or fart to scare away those who can smell.</p>
